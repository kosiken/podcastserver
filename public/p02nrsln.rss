            <title>MNC: Villa's fantasy nightmare &amp; top four favourites</title>
            <description>Mark Chapman is joined by Micah Richards, Chris Sutton &amp; Rory Smith for the Monday Night Club as they look at the race for the top four and the bizarre leaked news of Jack Grealish's injury via the medium of fantasy football!? 

We also debate England's embarrassment of riches in their midfield and attacking areas as the Euros get ever-closer. Can Gareth Southgate pick a winning formula with the talent at his disposal this summer? 

Plus, Jose Mourinho says his coaching methods are "second to nobody in the world" despite Tottenham's 2-1 defeat at West Ham, their fifth Premier League loss in six games.

TOPICS:

04:02: Jack Grealish, James Maddison and England's and embarrassment of riches.

09:46: Jack Grealish's injury leaked by Fantasy Football changes?

            <description>Jeanette Kwakye is joined by Ben Haines, Lianne Sanderson and Danny Simpson to discuss this weekend's football action. 

Everton finally tasted victory at Anfield - where will this defeat leave the Champions? Manchester City continue their excellent winning run sending them ten points clear at the top.

The panel also chat about Jesse Lingard’s performance so far at West Ham, Jose Mourinho's post match comments and Danny Simpson tell us which manager would make the team watch full matches back in silence to learn from their mistakes.</description>

Former Republic of Ireland forward Jonathan Walters joins the pod to talk about why he wants to be the new PFA CEO and how he would change the PFA for the better.

Plus, Clinton struggles to remember which Brazilian star he swapped shirts with after a game against R9, Ronaldinho and Cafu, and will Thierry Henry manage Bournemouth?

            <title>Liverpool back on track but Barca collapse (again)</title>
            <description>Kelly Cates and guests react to Liverpool ending their losing run with a fine performance in victory over Red Bull Leipzig in the Champions League. We discuss Curtis Jones' standout display and the German side's calamitous defensive performance. Kylian Mbappe scored a hat-trick as PSG thumped Barcelona at the Camp Nou but are these kind of defeats much of a surprise anymore for the Catalans? And in the EFL Dean Holden is sacked by Bristol City and a referee squares up to a player in League One.....

TOPICS

3m30 –  Liverpool looked so much better because they pressed so much more effectively from the front and Roberto Firmino produced a standout performance.

8m00 – Curtis Jones the latest example of technically gifted young British players and Klopp recognising him as an exceptional talent.  He will have the belief he can impact this team for the next 10 years. His swagger is what he will take him to the next level.

16m10 – Klopp audio

20m30 – Not for the first time a chastening defeat that feels like the end of an era for Barcelona.

22m10 – Barca have been a mess defensively all season. No blame on Koeman from fans or from inside the club.

24m20 – Barca will have to turn to the academy to re-build. There is no alternative and it will be a long road back.

25m30 – EFL chat including Dean Holden’s sacking at Bristol City</description>

            <title>Coco Pops, Mouldies and DIY Haircuts</title>
            <description>Alex Bruce and Sami Mokbel join Steve Crossman to preview Sunday’s Premier League games. Arsenal's Gabriel Martinelli gives his first ever interview in English whilst Leeds defender Luke Ayling tells us about being released from the North London club as a youngster and subsequent journey back to the Premier League and why late night bowls of Coco Pops are off the menu under Marcelo Bielsa.

TOPICS

9m30 – Luke Ayling interview

22m - Alex Bruce likens Luke Ayling’s career path to his own in terms of being released by a big club as a teenager and the education you get playing at lower league clubs.

24m30 – Arsenal have completely lost the balance between defence and attack. Not the way Arsenal supporters have been brought up watching attractive football.

30m – OGS managing expectations and taking pressure off players - but should he try and galvanise the club and make everyone believe they can win the title.

34m – Sam Allardyce not having the opportunity to do the required work on the training ground to sort the WBA defence and him biting off more than he can chew with the job at Albion.

35m30 – Are the relegation places already sewn up or do Fulham still have a chance?

37m – Will Fulham regret not getting an upgrade on Mitrovic this season?</description>

            <title>Shot locations, Phil Foden and the grit between your teeth</title>
            <description>Mark Chapman, Rory Smith, Chris Sutton and Micah Richards return with the Monday Night Club edition of the Football Daily.

With Phil Foden once again impressing, the team look at just how good the Man City midfielder could become.

They also assess where Liverpool’s problems lie after the weekend’s loss to Pep Guardiola’s side. And they ask why it’s taken so long for Newcastle to change their style of play.  Plus what's a shot location?

TOPICS:
1min - Chris jokes with Rory about ‘shot locations’

            <itunes:summary>Mark Chapman, Rory Smith, Chris Sutton and Micah Richards return with the Monday Night Club edition of the Football Daily.

With Phil Foden once again impressing, the team look at just how good the Man City midfielder could become.

They also assess where Liverpool’s problems lie after the weekend’s loss to Pep Guardiola’s side. And they ask why it’s taken so long for Newcastle to change their style of play.  Plus what's a shot location?

            <title>Local lads, Tuchel’s tactics and Roman footwear</title>
            <description>We hear from Trent Alexander-Arnold and Phil Foden ahead of Liverpool's clash with Manchester City and discuss the importance of having local lads in expensively-assembled squads of global stars. Matt Upson and Jason Burt also chat Thomas Tuchel's innovative start at Chelsea, Callum Hudson-Odoi and the re-integration of Marcos Alonso. And there's an unexpected bonus of a history lesson on the Romans from Matt.

TOPICS

5.00: How crucial Henderson and Fernandinho are to both teams style of play and allowing the attacking potential of the full backs.

10.30:Trent Alexander-Arnold interview

19.00: Matt Upson on local players being part of big clubs and the tighter bond they have. Tony Adams and Ray Parlour would keep players in check and make everyone aware of standards at Arsenal. New players soon understood the rules and what things were all about. Arsene Wenger was quite a nice balance because his mantra was just to allow players to express themselves.

24.00: Phil Foden interview

27.30: High quality holding midfielders from Brazil and Matt on playing with Gilberto Silva.

29.00: ‘Enigma’ Alonso back in at Chelsea.

41.00: Too much change at Wolves. Sold two big players, have changed system and Nuno playing a lot of youngsters.</description>

The guys also give us their stories of big career jumps after Ben Davies secured his dream move to Liverpool last week.

And after Chelsea F.C. Women boss Emma Hayes was linked with the vacant manager's job at AFC Wimbledon, the guys discuss how close we are to seeing female coaches in the men’s game.</description>

            <title>Football’s fight against racism on social media</title>
            <description>Emma Saunders is joined by former England and Chelsea forward Lianne Sanderson, former Leeds and Leicester midfielder Alex Bruce and Ben Haines from 90min to discuss what more needs to be done to tackle racism in football. 

As Manchester United’s Marcus Rashford was the latest player to be subjected to racist abuse on social media this weekend after a series of incidents, the panel speak about what needs to be done to stop it and Lianne and Alex share their own experiences of being abused online. 

After another busy weekend of Premier League action, the team dissect Tottenham’s shock 1-0 defeat to Brighton and debate why Gareth Bale’s return to Spurs hasn’t quite happened and why Mourinho didn’t start a recognised striker in Carlos Vinicius. 

We hear from Leeds striker Patrick Bamford who proved he is a ‘selfless striker’ in their victory over Leicester and discuss what went wrong for Brendan Rodgers’ side. 

Is Mo Salah really back? That’s the question we ask after Liverpool’s 3-1 victory over West Ham – keeping their title hopes alive.

And Alex gives us an insight into the Newcastle camp after his dad Steve Bruce saw his team run out 2-0 winners over Everton on Saturday.




Topics:

2.00 – Chat on the incidents of racist abuse against several footballers on social media over the weekend 

6.00 – Lianne opens up about abuse she has suffered on social media

8.00 – Alex talks about how he’s experienced online abuse

15.00 – Chat on how Spurs looked lost without injured Harry Kane

19.30 – Why Gareth Bale’s return hasn’t been a dream homecoming 

23.00 – Chat on why Carlos Vinicius didn’t start the match 

25.30 – Where did Leicester go wrong against Leeds

28.00 – Interview with Patrick Bamford

30.00 – Bamford being ‘selfless’ and is he England material?

32.00 – Alex on his childhood friend Kasper Schmeichel 

36.00 – Is Salah back?

38.30 – The importance of Henderson

42.00 – Alex gives us insight on the Newcastle camp</description>

            <title>Remembering Diego Maradona</title>
            <description>In this special episode of the Football Daily podcast Mark Chapman is joined by correspondent John Murray and South American football expert Tim Vickery to pay tribute to football legend Diego Maradona, who has died at the age of 60.

Maradona - arguably the greatest player football has ever seen - had a spectacular career: he captained Argentina to victory at the 1986 World Cup, and scoring both the infamous 'Hand of God' goal and the much-lauded solo second against England in their quarter-final. 

He spent much of his club career at Napoli, winning two Serie A titles, the Coppa Italia and UEFA Cup with the Italian side. He had previously played for Barcelona, Boca Juniors and Argentinos Juniors.

We hear from Gary Lineker, Pep Guardiola, Ossie Ardiles, and Paul Elliott - all paying tribute to the Argentine superstar.</description>

            <title>Bury FC expelled from the Football League</title>
            <description>Kelly Cates is joined by Steve Crossman and BBC Radio Manchester’s Mike Minay to react to the news that Bury Football Club has been expelled from the Football League. 

A takeover deal to buy Bury FC collapsed earlier on Tuesday and the club couldn’t prove to the EFL that it had the funds to continue or find a new buyer before the deadline of 5pm. 

The news broke at 11pm that the club had been expelled from the Football League and we were there to get the reaction from emotional fans who were still at Gigg Lane in the hope their club could be saved. 

We also discuss the news that Bolton Wanderers has been given an extension of 14 days, but as Mike explains, they could be the second club to be expelled from the Football League, sooner rather than later.</description>

            <title>All about Villa with Grealish, Smith, Mings and more</title>
            <description>In the first of our Premier League specials, Steve Crossman goes behind the scenes at Aston Villa ahead of the new season.

Learn how Jack Grealish's Mum was more worried than he was when he was attacked by a Birmingham fan, why Tyrone Mings knew he'd 'made it' when he upgraded his Citroën Saxo to a Vauxhall Corsa, why manager Dean Smith 'had to' sign over 10 players this summer and how we've all been pronouncing Conor Hourihane's name incorrectly.

If that isn't enough we also catch up with club captain James Chester and new signings Jota and Matt Targett.

Joining Steve throughout the pod is Villa legend Dion Dublin.</description>

            <title>Chris Smalling: Maidstone, Man United and Messi</title>
            <description>Chris Smalling talks about growing up in a one-parent family and how even though they couldn’t afford his bus fare to go to football training sessions, he still managed to make it from non-league Maidstone to Manchester United.
